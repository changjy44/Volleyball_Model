- This repository contains all code/work done for FYP (Sports Analytics using Machine Learning)
- Scrapers and models may not work as intended out of the box, slight modifications may be needed depending on the type of system running it.
- It is recommended to create a separate python environment in each of the `prediction` and `scraper` folders.
